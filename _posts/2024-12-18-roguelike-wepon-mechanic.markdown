Link to the [mechanics project][mechanics]

Third year Uni project that uses UE 5 to create a weapon system that allows the player to pick up available weapons and modify their behavior depending on the location within the players inventory.

The player can drag and drop equipped weapons (in inventory) to change the weapon behavior on the fly and cause additional interactions with the weapons in game.
