# Hello there, I'm Alistair
I'm a 4th year Computer Game Applications Development (CGAD) student at Abertay University.

I'm interested in all topics of game dev but with a particular interest with game mechanics and systems in rougelites/rougelikes.
I've have experience primarily in C++ but have also used C# and GDscript. I've also used various game engines such as Unreal Engine 5, Unity, Godot and Skateboard (Abertay University in-house engine for PS5).

Aside from game dev, I'm an avid film fan (in partifcular sci-fi and horror) as well as tinkering with a home lab server.

# Recent events
Over the summer, my team and I [Bonny Bandits][BonnyLink] were Dare Academy finalists in which we continued development of our Abertay professional project [Synaptic][SynLink]: A walking simulator/gallery shooter built with Unreal Engine 5.

Currently I've just starting 4th year at Abertay in which networking and audio programming will be taught. Finally, my honours project is also being developed this year with discussions about the topic underway.

The [home][homeLink] page will showcase all my current work.
